Synaptic rewiring in the brain occurs throughout life. There is tight interplay between structural changes in the connectivity between neurons and the efficacy of existing connections. It has been found that topographic organization enables to achieve homeostasis for neuronal activity between regions, especially sensory connections to the central nervous system. This work extends previous work done using a structural synaptic plasticity mechanism towards a biologically-inspired vision system. Accuracy of classification and speed of learning are evaluated by varying the number of hidden layers in the network. The system may learn the statistics of the inputs in an online fashion without supervision, pointing the way to engineered vision systems with similar online learning capabilities. Moreover, we show the presented model can be used to classify handwritten digits by generating topographic maps between layers of neurons with small number of connections. The proposed approaches provides valuable insights to understand the phenomena of a neural circuit by increasing its scale in a structured manner.
